# Highway Car Dataset and Model Training

This is for the third project in my Computer Vision class.The goal is to create an end-to-end model that, given some data, will perform some task.

The task that I've settled on is given a video of some cars on the highway, find the peak times for traffic (basically, when are there the most cars on the highway). 

The goal will be to use Yolov5 to do this, so this readme will serve as a breathing document throughout this process. We will have to see.
